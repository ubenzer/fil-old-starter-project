# I need metaltext

I need metaltext because I find Wordpress and all other dynamic blog engines heavy for publishing small blogs.

---more---

I shouldn't need a PHP hosting or anything to publish a website. I shouldn't need a DB just to write blog! They can be all static, which also means speed!

I researched and couldn't find a static blog engine that is written in a language I understand. Jekyll was fine but `ruby` is like _Arabic_ to me.

So, hello *metaltext*!
